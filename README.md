# A study of machine learning-based driver drowsiness detection systems  
The application of machine learning in driver drowsiness systems is crucial in enhancing road safety and mitigating accidents resulting from driver weariness. These systems has the capability to promptly identify signs of drowsiness by examining facial expressions, eye movements, and drowsiness indicators such as yawning. By disseminating prompt notifications, they aid in the prevention of accidents and offer drivers early indications, allowing them to manage fatigue prior to it reaching a critical state. Furthermore, these systems maintain a constant surveillance of drivers without generating any interruptions, thereby offering significant data insights for enhancing safety measures.  
    
**Usage**  :  
To initiate the drowsiness detector, execute the detector.py file. In order to utilize the sleepiness detector module, it is necessary to have two model.h5 files that are stored within the same directory. Additionally, it is imperative to give the file path for these model files.The input to the detector module comprises an image. To enable real-time detection, the video is inputted into the detector as a series of frames, facilitating the production of outcomes for each individual frame.  

**Dataset**  
The dataset is a standard image dataset for both Eye state and Yawn Detection consistsing 600 images per class.
